## Coding Standards

To maintain consistency and quality, please follow these guidelines:

- **Code Style**  
  - Follow standard Java conventions (e.g., 4 spaces for indentation).
  - Ensure your code is clean, modular, and well-documented.

- **Naming Conventions**  
  - Use descriptive and meaningful variable, method, and class names.
  - Follow camelCase for variables and methods, and PascalCase for class names.

- **Dependency Management**  
  - Add Maven dependencies judiciously and avoid unnecessary ones.
  - Ensure dependencies are compatible with Spring Boot.

- **Configuration**  
  - Use properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml` for external configurations.

## Testing

Before submitting changes, ensure that:

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - Write unit tests for any new feature or bug fix.
   - Tests should cover edge cases and core functionality.

2. **Run All Tests**  
   Execute all tests to confirm nothing is broken:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

3. **Integration Tests**
